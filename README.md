Usage
=============

This tool is designed as a wrapper for the popular .NET application
"scallion" which uses GPUs to bruteforce .onion (Tor) hostname/key pairs.
In order to use multiscallion you will first need to install mono and
then download and compile scallion.  (Links Below)  Once you've got both
setup, open up the script and setup your config options.  Then just
run it and wait :)
